“Run, Schuyler,” my aunt hissed.
“Why?” I asked.
“He’s figured it out.”
	The man ahead of us had stopped walking with his head tilted in our direction, his nostrils flaring. He took a step toward us, and Aunt Lenore shoved me in the opposite direction. My feet moved of their own volition as I took off down a back alley, my aunt right behind me. 
	Sewage and other noxious odors bombarded my nose, but it wouldn’t disguise my scent from the vampire following us. As he grew closer, Aunt Lenore whirled around. He lunged, but she sidestepped and kicked him against the brick wall. He collapsed on the pavement.
“Keep going, Schuyler,” she said.
“Not without you.”
The vampire surged to his feet, baring his fangs, and leapt into the air. He landed on the fire escape above us, sneering.
