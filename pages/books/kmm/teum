As he arrived in the new time, the intruder fell backward and rolled to his feet. 
He stood and glanced around the room, his weapon in his hand. 
He had landed in the living area and it was dark, apart from the glow of the streets below against the ceiling. 
The place smelled fresh and clean, as only newly renovated apartments do. 
Without a sound, he made his way to the closed bedroom door. 
There was a light coming from under it and he smiled to himself. 
They're all done.
